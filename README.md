# Classifiers-Data-Mining
Classifiers such as K Nearest Neighbors, Centroid, Linear Regression and Support Vector Machine are used to predict the class of a set of Handwritten data. Accuracy and Cross Validation is also calculated for all these classifiers.
Cross Validation is done for 2-fold,3-fold,5-fold and 10-fold.
Graph is plotted using matplotlib using accuracy of the classifers.
